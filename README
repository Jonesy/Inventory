INVENTORY
==================

Inventory is a basic inline file browser for rapid toggling
between HTML templates during development. The idea behind it
is that the average front-end developer doesn't necessarily 
hard-link all the templates together in the HTML <a> tags,
but still needs to flip between individual HTML files to preview
changes and ensure the front face is running smoothly. This
app tries to enable speedy page template switching with an
easily accessible, unobtrusive interface. It's still in early
proof-of-concept, and will be continually evolved.


INSTALLATION
------------
To install, just drag these files into you server root:

/
 - Inventory.php,
 - /Inventory/inventory-boot.js
 - /Inventory/inventory.js

Near the bottom of your <HEAD> include the JS bootstrap:

<script src="/Inventory/inventory-boot.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

* Future releases will hopefully have the PHP into the "Inventory" subdirectory.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Requires PHP4+. I assume you work the webroot of you computer, Apache, 
and set up virtual hosts.As of this release I have not checked how well
this runs on a live server.
